# Side Stacker

Test description: https://docs.monadical.com/s/monadical-study-guide#Difficulty-Advanced-full-stack

I timeboxed myself and was feeling a bit sick, so:

* A bunch of todo's
* Code not as elegant as I would like
* [Programmer Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer_art) UI
* Not enough tests

But hey it's playable and you should be able to pick enough signal about my coding
